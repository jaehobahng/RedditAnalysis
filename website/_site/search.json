    "text": "What should a mother do if she discovers her son is dating her best friend? What should a husband do when he realizes his marriage is failing after decades, yet feels too embarrassed to tell friends and family he wants a divorce? What about the wife who walks in on her husband of 23 years having an affair with her brother? And what of the more mundane, everyday dilemmas? Where can people turn when they need objective opinions on deeply personal issues, beyond what close friends and family might offer?\nFor more than half a century, people have struggled with all kinds of concerns and questions about their marriages, relationships, friendships, and even themselves. The advent of anonymous posting and virtual communities, such as Reddit, has given individuals a platform to share their problems with the world and receive advice from anyone willing to listen.\nBefore Reddit (founded in 2005) and the rise of online communities, one of the most popular ways to seek public advice was through newspaper advice columns. For over half a century, Dear Abby—America’s longest-running advice column, first written by Pauline Phillips (under the pseudonym Abigail van Buren) and later by her daughter Jeanne—offered counsel to thousands of troubled readers. At its peak, the column was syndicated in more than 1,200 newspapers, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the concerns dominating American life. It has been continuously in print since 1956, serving as a unique cultural touchstone.\nOn Reddit, users find solace in various advice-focused subreddits, each catering to different types of personal quandaries.\n\n\n\nfigure: headline of r/AmITheAsshole\n\n\nr/AmITheAsshole is a space where users can share morally complex situations and ask for judgment on whether they were in the wrong.\n\n\n\nfigure: headline of r/AskReddit\n\n\nr/AskReddit serves as a general forum where individuals can pose open-ended questions to the broader Reddit community, often about life challenges and social dilemmas.\n\n\n\nfigure: headline of r/AmIOverreacting\n\n\nMeanwhile, r/AmIOverreacting provides a place for people to seek validation and perspective on whether their emotional responses are justified.\nBy examining advice-seeking posts on Reddit and questions from “Dear Abby” columns, we have an opportunity to explore the evolving landscape of American worries from 1985 to 2023. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML), this project aims to uncover trends in the anxieties that have troubled Americans over nearly four decades, generating powerful insights in a clear and accessible manner.\n\nThe Project\nOur exploration spans various appraoches, SUMMARIZE EDA AND NLP HERE:\n\n\nProject Goals\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

But first, it’s necessary to get a sense of how many topics are most discussed by people across all years. The visualization below used gensim and pyLDAvis to visualize the topics of all the questions posted on Dear Abby’s from year 1985 to 2017."
