# Executive Summary

Our analysis explores how users engage with advice-seeking platforms, focusing on Reddit subreddits **AskReddit**, **AmItheAsshole**, and **AmIOverreacting**, and comparing them to the iconic **Dear Abby** advice column. The results highlight significant differences in platform dynamics, engagement levels, and audience behaviors. While **AskReddit** dominates in terms of post volume and engagement due to its broad appeal, **AmItheAsshole** provides structured feedback on ethical dilemmas, making it a hub for direct and decisive user opinions. **AmIOverreacting**, though smaller and newer, shows strong engagement relative to its size and employs a structured feedback system similar to **AmItheAsshole**, enabling users to receive validation or critique on their emotional responses.

The data also reveals that posts on Reddit are far more frequent than those in **Dear Abb**y, with individual subreddits surpassing the monthly activity of the column at its peak. Interestingly, while shorter posts dominate **AskReddit**, the subreddit still achieves the highest virality rate, showing that concise content can resonate deeply with audiences. Conversely, **AmItheAsshole** posts are often longer and more detailed, reflecting the complexity of the moral dilemmas discussed. The anonymous nature of Reddit fosters candid conversations, including a notable percentage of explicit (NSFW) content, particularly on **AskReddit** and **AmIOverreacting**.

These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how users engage with these platforms, revealing distinct behavioral patterns and thematic trends. This analysis lays the groundwork for deeper investigations, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and predicting community judgments, to further uncover the motivations and themes that drive engagement in online advice-seeking communities.

# Data Ingestion and Cleaning

## Reddit Data Retrieval

We began by retrieving data from our professor's **Amazon S3 bucket**, which had been collected via the Reddit API. The dataset was analyzed using **AWS SageMaker** and **PySpark** in JupyterLab. The data included posts and comments from three subreddits: [AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) (AITA), [AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/), and [AmIOverreacting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/) (AIOR).

## Posts Data Cleaning

### Initial Dataset

The initial dataset for posts contained over **3 million entries**, including some of Reddit's largest subreddits: AITA and AskReddit. Given the size and scope of the data, we established cleaning protocols to ensure meaningful and robust analysis.

### Cleaning Steps

1. **Removing Empty Text:** Posts with removed or missing content (selftext = '[removed]') were excluded to focus only on posts with substantial text data.
2. **Filtering by Engagement:** Since our subreddits focus on seeking feedback, we applied comment thresholds to retain posts with significant engagement.

* AITA: Posts with fewer than **25 comments** were removed.
* AIOR: Posts with fewer than **15 comments** were removed.
* AskReddit: Posts with fewer than **50 comments** were removed.

These thresholds were chosen based on the summary statistics (mean, median, and quantiles) of comment counts per post, ensuring a representative sample of well-engaged posts.

### Final Dataset

After cleaning, the dataset was reduced to approximately **80,000 posts** across the three subreddits, retaining high-quality and meaningful entries for analysis.

## Comments Data Cleaning

### Initial Dataset

The comments dataset initially contained over **76 million** entries, representing a vast array of user interactions on the three subreddits.

### Cleaning Steps

1. **Removing Empty Text:** Comments with removed or missing content (body = '[removed]') were excluded to focus on meaningful user responses.
2. **Joining with Posts:** To ensure all comments were tied to a relevant post, we joined the comments dataframe with the cleaned posts dataframe, removing orphaned comments.
3. **Filtering for Immediate Feedback:** Reddit is a platform known for its fast-paced interactions, especially in these subreddits. To capture this dynamic, we:

* Created a top_level_comment variable (binary) to isolate comments directly responding to the original post.
* Attempted to analyze deeper comment threads recursively (using methods like graphs/nodes in Pandas and PySpark), but computational limitations made this infeasible due to the dataset's size.

4. **Time-Based Filtering:** A time_since_post variable was calculated, measuring the time in hours between a post's creation and its comments. Only comments made within 24 hours of a post were retained, reflecting the immediacy of feedback typical in these subreddits.

### Final Dataset

The final comments dataset was reduced to approximately **19 million** comments, representing meaningful, top-level feedback tied to posts with significant engagement. Each cleaning decision was made after carefully examining the data and guided by the unique dynamics of Reddit's feedback mechanisms.

## External Data: Dear Abby

To complement our Reddit analysis, we incorporated the **Dear Abby** dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/american-anxieties-dear-abby-s-questions) and featured in The Pudding’s essay, [30 Years of American Anxieties](https://pudding.cool/2018/11/dearabby/). This dataset includes 20,000 questions submitted to the advice column from 1985 to 2017, offering a historical perspective on public concerns.

Data Preparation
	1.	Removed incomplete entries and standardized text formatting.
	2.	Retained submissions within the 1985–2017 time frame.

This dataset serves as a baseline for comparing traditional advice-seeking behavior with Reddit’s dynamic, real-time interactions, helping to explore how platform design and anonymity shape public concerns.
